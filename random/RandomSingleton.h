/**
   Most often you only want, or need, a single random number generator
   in your programs. This class facilitates those needs, and ensures
   that there is only one instance of it and that there is only one
   global point of access to it. This class is a wrapper to the
   rlu_random random number generator.

   This is probably not thread safe.
